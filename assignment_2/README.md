## Assignment 2
Paper: _Diffusion Models Beat GANs on Image Synthesis_
### Objective
Replicate a subset of the experiments presented in the paper, including:
* Train a diffusion model on a subset of mentioned datasets (LSUN & Imagenet), possibly without classifier guidance and evaluate the trained model on the chosen dataset.
* Evaluate the BigGAN-deep model on the chosen dataset.
* Compare and discuss the evaluation results.

### Action Items
* Decide on a specific dataset and use it across different parts.
* Set up the evaluation schemes for both trained diffusion model.
* Find a trained BigGAN-deep model trained on the chosen dataset.
